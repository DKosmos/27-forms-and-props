===

## Requirements

Create a **stack.js** module that contains a stack constructor and the following methods:

* `push` - pushes an element onto the stack
* `pop` - removes an element from the stack
* `peek` - gets the top element of the stack
* `getMin` - gets the minimum element in the stack - this should work for positive **and** negative values

**Note:** Your stack implementation may be created using the `class` syntax, if you choose.

## Submission Instructions

1. With your assigned partner, pseudocode your solution on the whiteboard. Take a picture of your proposed solution for your repo.
1. Make a new branch and folder in your whiteboard challenge repository on GitHub. The name of the folder should be the same as the name of the challenge.
1. This folder should contain:
  - A file named `stack.js` which contains the JavaScript solution
  - A `__test__` directory that includes your `stack.test.js` file and associated tests
  - A picture of your pseudocoded solution from the whiteboarding exercise
  - A `README.md` which includes the problem domain
1. Complete the whiteboard challenge in your text editor, and verify that it's functional
1. Make a pull request from your working branch to your master branch
1. Submit a link to your PR on Canvas or submit a link to your `repo/daily-whiteboarding-directory/stack.js`
